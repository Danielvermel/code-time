# code-time

This was one of the projects I developed during University. The goal of this was to develop a webpage where I had a Java backend connected to a MySQL database. If you want to have a look at this project you can acces my live version [Code Time](https://code-time-app.herokuapp.com/index).

## How to Run the Project

* Make sure you have Java installed in your system;
* Make sure you have [Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) installed to create the database; 

In your Workbench run:
